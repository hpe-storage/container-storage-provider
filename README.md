# Container Storage Provider (CSP)

The Container Storage Provider (CSP) is a REST API specification that defines how provisioning, mounting, and deallocation workflows will be invoked from a host client that intends to use a storage provider.  Any storage vendor that intends to use the [HPE CSI Driver](https://github.com/hpe-storage/csi-driver) must implement the specification defined herein.

This repo contains the CSP [specification](spec.md) file.
